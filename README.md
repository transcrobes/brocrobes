Brocrobes
=========

`Brocrobes` is the Chrome-compatible web extension for interacting with the content enrichment system of Transcrobes (https://transcrob.es). It allows you to take (virtually) any webpage and enrich it with personalised, hypertext-based comprehension aids. It requires an existing account on a [Transcrobes](https://transcrob.es) server. 

All [Transcrobes](https://transcrob.es) software, including `brocrobes`, is open source and is initially being developed as part of [Anton Melser's](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/david-anton-melser\(f4f05196-8023-4854-801a-e29947855cfe\).html) PhD research platform.

Documentation
=============
See https://transcrob.es for more information about the component parts and the ongoing research project it is a part of.

Status
======
Brocrobes is currently alpha software, and is being actively developed as part of an academic research project.

Installation
============

Installation can either be done from the Chrome Web Store by searching for `brocrobes`, or by putting Chrome in developer mode, cloning/downloading this repository and then pointing to the `src` directory. See the Chrome website for further instructions on installing extensions in developer mode.

Configuration
=============

There are currently no public Transcrobes servers so you will need your own server installation for this extension to be of any use. See https://transcrob.es on how to install a Transcrobes server.

If you are *actively* learning Chinese, have native-like English, and you are willing to participate in Anton Melser's PhD research, then please contact him at anton@transcrob.es about getting an account. Participating in the research will give you free access until at least 2023, and you will always be able to install and manage your own platform.

You will also need a user to be created on the server, a username and password for accessing the server, along with the server's publicly accessible URL.

You should then go to the extension properties page and fill in these values. Until you fill in correct values there, clicking the "Transcrobe me!" button/menu entry will fail. Error messages only appear in the developer console.

Development
===========
Please [check the issues (and create if needed)](https://gitlab.com/transcrobes/brocrobes/issues) for things to work on.
